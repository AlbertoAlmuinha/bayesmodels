random_walk_stan_fit_impl(
  x,
  y,
  seasonal = FALSE,
  m = 0,
  chains = 4,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe of xreg (exogenous regressors)}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of values to fit}

\item{seasonal}{a Boolean value for select a seasonal random walk instead}

\item{m}{an optional integer value for the seasonal period.}

\item{chains}{An integer of the number of Markov Chains chains to be run, by default 4 chains are run.}

\item{iter}{An integer of total iterations per chain including the warm-up, by default the number of iterations are 2000.}

\item{warmup}{A positive integer specifying number of warm-up (aka burn-in) iterations. This also specifies the number of iterations used for step-size adaptation, so warm-up samples should not be used for inference. The number of warmup should not be larger than iter and the default is iter/2.}

\item{adapt.delta}{An optional real value between 0 and 1, the thin of the jumps in a HMC method. By default is 0.9}

\item{tree.depth}{An integer of the maximum depth of the trees evaluated during each iteration. By default is 10.}

\item{seed}{An integer with the seed for using when predicting with the model.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{forecast::Arima}}
}
\value{
A modeltime model
